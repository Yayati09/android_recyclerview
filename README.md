# android_recyclerview

If your app needs to display a scrolling list of <b>elements based on large data sets (or data that frequently changes)</b>, you should use RecyclerView as described on this page.

The RecyclerView widget is a more <b>advanced and flexible version of ListView</b>.

In this project I have included two textview for each row and images you can see that is set background for layout.

<b>Steps to implement recyclerview is af follows:</b>

<b>1. Gradle Scripts > build.gradle and inside dependencies</b>
      dependencies { 
               compile "com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.0.1â€œ
       }
<b>2. In Android a RecyclerView needs to have a Layout Manager and an Adapter to be instantiated. Layout Manager is a very new concept introduced in RecyclerView for defining the type of Layout which RecyclerView should use. </b><br><br>
